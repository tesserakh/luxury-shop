# Online Shop Revenue Analytics

## Description

What's contains on this project:

- Web scraper in a daily scheduled
- Sales data sets after preliminary analysis
- A visual dashboard

The store is a [luxury bags and accessories](https://luxurybyho.com). All the product items have just a single stock on the catalog. When the status "in stock" changed to "out stock" you will know it has been sold. New items will be added to the new product links.

The informations scraped are:

- Product name
- Product price (with currency)
- Discount price
- Availability (in stock/ out stock)
- Product photo url
- Product details (brand, color, etc.)
- Date collected

So, you will know how long it took to sell, from when it was first seen to when it was "out stock" (date of sale). Then calculate the revenue.

The dashboard will help you to display in a way, so you can easily see the shop's daily, weekly, or monthly revenue; when the product is sold; how many item can be sold; etc.
